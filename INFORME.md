1. **Main Module (main.cpp)**

   - **Responsibility**:
     - Program entry point: The `main()` function is where everything starts.
     - Command-line parsing: This module will interpret the user’s command-line arguments and decide what action to take (e.g., listing processes, monitoring resources, terminating a process).
     - Coordinator: It will instantiate other modules and coordinate their interactions (e.g., calling functions to list processes, monitor resources, or handle termination).
   - **Key Functions**:
     - `int main(int argc, char* argv[])`: Parse the command-line arguments and invoke appropriate actions (e.g., `listProcesses()`, `monitorResources()`, `terminateProcess()`).
   - **Example of command-line arguments**:
     - `./process_manager list`: List processes.
     - `./process_manager monitor`: Start monitoring CPU and memory usage.
     - `./process_manager terminate <PID>`: Terminate a specific process.

2. **Process Manager Module (process\_manager.cpp)**

   - **Responsibility**:
     - Listing active processes: This module will handle fetching the list of active processes from the system.
     - Multithreading for process retrieval: It will use multiple threads to gather process information (e.g., PID, name, CPU usage, memory usage) to improve performance.
     - Efficient data collection: This will ensure that even under high load, process data can be retrieved efficiently.
   - **Key Functions**:
     - `void listProcesses()`: Fetch and display the list of running processes with their details (PID, name, CPU usage, memory usage). Use multithreading to optimize data fetching for high efficiency.
   - **Example**:
     - Retrieve information from `/proc` (Linux) or use system commands like `ps` or `top` in the background.
   - **Multithreading**:
     - Use a thread pool to spawn multiple threads, each responsible for retrieving a specific process’ data concurrently.

3. **Resource Monitoring Module (resource\_monitor.cpp)**

   - **Responsibility**:
     - Real-time monitoring of CPU and memory usage.
     - Multithreading for monitoring: Similar to process listing, it will use multithreading to handle different resources (CPU and memory) concurrently, so that the tool does not consume too much time or resources.
   - **Key Functions**:
     - `void monitorCPU()`: Continuously track CPU usage in real-time. Example: Use system APIs (e.g., `/proc/stat` on Linux) to fetch CPU stats.
     - `void monitorMemory()`: Continuously track memory usage in real-time. Example: Use `/proc/meminfo` or system-specific tools to track memory stats.
   - **Multithreading for parallel monitoring**:
     - Monitor multiple resources simultaneously by delegating tasks to separate threads.

4. **Process Control Module (process\_control.cpp)**

   - **Responsibility**:
     - Terminate processes: This module will handle the logic for terminating processes based on a given PID.
     - Permissions management: Ensure that only processes that the user has permission to terminate are actually terminated.
     - Error handling: Ensure that any failures, such as invalid PIDs or permission issues, are handled appropriately.
   - **Key Functions**:
     - `void terminateProcess(int pid)`: Accept a PID and attempt to terminate the corresponding process. Use system calls like `kill(pid, SIGTERM)` or `kill(pid, SIGKILL)` for process termination. Handle permission errors (e.g., root privileges required to terminate system-critical processes).
     - **Logging**: Log any errors or actions that occur while trying to terminate a process (e.g., invalid PID, lack of permission).

5. **Logging Module (logger.cpp)**

   - **Responsibility**:
     - Logging system actions: Every significant action, such as listing processes, monitoring resources, or terminating processes, should be logged.
     - Timestamping: Logs should include a timestamp to keep track of when the event occurred.
     - Error logging: Log errors encountered during execution (e.g., failed to fetch process data, failed to terminate process, permission issues).
   - **Key Functions**:
     - `void log(const std::string& message)`: Write log messages to a file or standard output. Include timestamps for each log entry.
     - `void logError(const std::string& errorMessage)`: Specifically for logging errors, e.g., failed process termination or insufficient permissions.

6. **Utility Module (utils.cpp)**

   - **Responsibility**:
     - Utility functions: This will contain general-purpose helper functions like thread management and thread pooling, which will be used across various parts of the project.
     - Thread management: Functions for creating threads, managing thread synchronization, and pooling threads efficiently.
     - Data handling: Helper functions for handling data safely between threads (e.g., using mutexes or other synchronization methods).
   - **Key Functions**:
     - `void createThread(std::function<void()> func)`: A helper function to easily create and manage threads.
     - `void threadPool(int numThreads, std::function<void()> task)`: Create a pool of threads to perform tasks concurrently.
     - **Thread-safe data collection**: Use mutexes or other synchronization mechanisms to ensure safe, thread-safe collection of data (e.g., CPU and memory stats).

7. **Tests**

   - **Unit Testing** is crucial to ensure that your code is functioning correctly and to prevent future regressions.
   - Test each module separately to verify their individual functionality:
     - **Process Manager**: Test if processes are listed correctly.
     - **Resource Monitor**: Test if CPU and memory usage are monitored properly.
     - **Process Control**: Test if processes can be terminated correctly and handle errors (e.g., invalid PIDs).
     - **Logger**: Test if logs are generated correctly and timestamped.
   - For testing, you can create mock functions and test each module independently before integrating them.
