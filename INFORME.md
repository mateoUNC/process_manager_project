# Process Manager Documentation

## Introduction

The **Process Manager** is a comprehensive application designed to monitor and manage system processes on a Linux-based operating system. It provides users with a suite of tools to track resource usage, retrieve detailed information about active processes, and perform actions such as terminating processes. The primary aim of this program is to offer an intuitive and efficient interface for understanding and managing system performance, catering to both casual users and system administrators.

### Key Features:
- **Process Monitoring**: Continuously tracks active processes, displaying critical information such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and the command associated with each process.
- **Resource Usage Analysis**: Provides real-time calculations of CPU and memory usage, enabling users to identify resource-intensive processes.
- **Process Termination**: Allows users to safely and efficiently terminate processes by specifying their Process ID (PID).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Displays process information in a clear, formatted table for easy readability.
- **Customizable Commands**: Supports command-line options for flexibility, enabling users to list processes, monitor resources, or manage specific processes.

### Use Cases:
1. **System Performance Monitoring**:
   - Detect and troubleshoot resource-intensive processes affecting system performance.
   - Gain insights into CPU and memory utilization across all active processes.

2. **System Administration**:
   - Monitor and manage server processes in real-time.
   - Identify and terminate misbehaving or unnecessary processes to maintain system stability.

3. **Development and Debugging**:
   - Observe the behavior of application processes during runtime.
   - Evaluate the resource footprint of custom applications under different conditions.

The Process Manager is built using modular components, each handling a distinct aspect of the programâ€™s functionality, such as retrieving process data, monitoring resource usage, or managing user interactions. This documentation will guide you through the codebase, explaining each module's responsibilities, key functions, and integration points within the application.

# Process Control Module Documentation

## Overview

The **Process Control Module** provides the functionality to manage and terminate processes on the system. It allows for controlled termination of individual processes, as well as batch operations based on criteria such as CPU usage or user ownership. By integrating robust error handling mechanisms, the module ensures safe execution of these actions without disrupting system stability.

---

## Functions

### 1. `bool killProcess(int pid)`
#### Description
Attempts to terminate a process with the specified Process ID (PID). This function sends a `SIGKILL` signal to the target process and handles common errors to ensure the operation is performed safely.

#### Parameters
- `pid`: The Process ID of the process to terminate.

#### Returns
- `true`: If the process was successfully terminated.
- `false`: If the termination failed due to invalid PID, insufficient permissions, or other errors.

#### Key Details
- Validates the PID to ensure it corresponds to an active process.
- Prevents termination of the current process to avoid self-induced shutdowns.
- Logs any errors encountered during the operation.

---

### 2. `bool killProcessesByCpu(double threshold)`
#### Description
Terminates all processes whose CPU usage exceeds a specified percentage threshold. This is particularly useful for managing runaway processes that consume excessive CPU resources.

#### Parameters
- `threshold`: The CPU usage percentage above which processes will be terminated.

#### Returns
- `true`: If at least one process was terminated.
- `false`: If no processes met the criteria or if all attempts failed.

#### Key Details
- Iterates through the list of monitored processes to evaluate their CPU usage.
- Sends `SIGKILL` signals to processes exceeding the threshold.
- Logs the outcome of each termination attempt, including successes and failures.

---

### 3. `bool killProcessesByUser(const std::string& username)`
#### Description
Terminates all processes owned by a specific user. This function is helpful for managing processes tied to a particular user account.

#### Parameters
- `username`: The username whose processes will be terminated.

#### Returns
- `true`: If at least one process was terminated.
- `false`: If no processes matched the user or if all attempts failed.

#### Key Details
- Maps the username to a user ID (UID) for process identification.
- Iterates through monitored processes and sends `SIGKILL` signals to matching entries.
- Logs successes and errors for each termination attempt.

---

## Error Handling

The module includes robust error handling to address:
- **Invalid Process IDs**: Ensures that termination attempts are only made on valid PIDs.
- **Insufficient Permissions**: Verifies user privileges before attempting to kill processes.
- **System Integrity**: Prevents accidental termination of critical system processes or the current process.

---

## Integration Points

- **Main Module**: Integrates the process control functions for user commands like `terminate`.
- **Logging Module**: Logs all actions and errors for traceability and debugging purposes.
- **Resource Monitoring Module**: Supplies the process data needed for filtering and identifying target processes.

# Process Display Module Documentation

## Overview

The **Process Display Module** is responsible for presenting process information to the user in a structured and readable format. By applying sorting and filtering criteria, this module ensures that the most relevant process data is displayed clearly and effectively. This functionality is crucial for enabling users to monitor and manage processes efficiently.

---

## Functions

### 1. `void printProcesses(const std::vector<Process>& processes)`
#### Description
Displays a list of processes in a neatly formatted table. This function prints the details of each process, including:
- **Process ID (PID)**
- **User owning the process**
- **CPU usage percentage**
- **Memory usage in MB**
- **Command name**

#### Parameters
- `processes`: A vector of `Process` structs containing information about active processes. Each `Process` struct includes attributes such as PID, user, CPU usage, memory usage, and the associated command.

#### Key Details
- **Formatting**: Uses standardized column widths and alignment (e.g., `std::setw`, `std::left`, `std::right`) to ensure readability.
- **Sorting and Filtering**:
  - Processes can be sorted based on CPU or memory usage for prioritization.
  - Filters can exclude processes based on user-defined criteria (e.g., specific users or low resource usage).
- **Headers**:
  - Displays column headers (e.g., `PID`, `User`, `CPU (%)`, `Memory (MB)`, `Command`) for easy identification of data fields.
- **Pagination** (Optional): Limits the number of displayed processes, such as showing the top 30 by default.

#### Example Output
```
 PID   User      CPU (%)   Memory (MB)   Command
-------------------------------------------------
 1234  root      15.2      200.3         apache2
 5678  user1      8.5      102.1         chrome
 9101  user2      1.3       50.0         vim
```

## Error Handling

The module gracefully handles scenarios such as:
- **Empty Data**: Displays a message if no processes meet the filtering criteria.
- **Long Command Names**: Truncates excessively long command strings to fit within column limits while appending an ellipsis (`...`).
- **Invalid Data**: Skips over corrupted or incomplete `Process` entries, logging an error if necessary.
